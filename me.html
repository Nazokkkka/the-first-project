    <h4>“Music is a big part of my life. It helps me relax, express my emotions, and even find inspiration. Whether I’m feeling happy, sad, or anything in between, there’s always a song that fits my mood. Music connects me to different cultures and perspectives, and it’s amazing how it can bring people together. For me, listening to music is more than just a hobby—it’s a way to escape, reflect, and enjoy life.”</h4>
